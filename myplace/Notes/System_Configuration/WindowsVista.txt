Boot sector restoration tool



Bootsect.exe updates the master boot code for hard disk partitions in order to

switch between BOOTMGR and NTLDR.  You can use this tool to restore the boot

sector on your computer.



/help   Displays these usage instructions.



/nt52   Applies the master boot code that is compatible with NTLDR to SYS,

        ALL, or <DriveLetter>.  The operating system installed on SYS, ALL, or

        <DriveLetter> must be older than Windows Vista.



/nt60   Applies the master boot code that is compatible with BOOTMGR to SYS,

        ALL, or <DriveLetter>.  The operating system installed on SYS, ALL, or

        <DriveLetter> must be Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008.



SYS     Updates the master boot code on the system partition used to boot

        Windows.



ALL     Updates the master boot code on all partitions.  ALL does not

        necessarily update the boot code for each volume.  Instead, this

        option updates the boot code on volumes that could be used as Windows

        boot volumes, which excludes any dynamic volumes that are not

        connected with an underlying disk partition.  This restriction is

        present because boot code must be located at the beginning of a disk

        partition.



<DriveLetter> Updates the master boot code on the volume associated with this

        drive letter.  Boot code will not be updated if either 1)

        <DriveLetter> is not associated with a volume or 2) <DriveLetter> is

        associated with a volume not connected to an underlying disk

        partition.



/force  Forcibly dismounts the volume(s) during the boot code update.  You

        should use this option with caution.



        If Bootsect.exe cannot gain exclusive volume access then the file

        system may overwrite the boot code before the next reboot.

        Bootsect.exe always attempts to lock and dismount the volume before

        each update.  When /force is specified, a forced dismount is attempted

        if the initial lock attempt fails.  A lock can fail, for example, if

        files on the target volume are currently opened by other programs.



        When successful, a forced dismount allows exclusive volume access and

        a reliable boot code update even though the initial lock failed.  At

        the same time, a forced dismount invalidates all open handles to files

        on the target volume.  This could result in unexpected behavior from

        the programs that opened these files.  Therefore, you should use this

        option with caution.



/mbr    Updates the Master Boot Record without changing the partition table on

        sector 0 of the disk that contains the partition specified by SYS, ALL,

        or drive letter.  When used with /nt52 option, the master boot record

        is compatible with operating systems older than Windows Vista.  When

        used with the /nt60 option, the master boot record is compatible with

        Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008.



Example:



To apply the master boot code that is compatible with NTLDR to the volume

labeled E:, use the following command:



bootsect /nt52 E:

* 来源：
该工具位于Vista CD /boot目录之下。

* 备注：
在Vista下面运行该工具不一定能修复系统所在盘的MBR。

== 激活 ==
=== Vista loader v2.1.5 ===
* 使用方法：
运行程序目录下面的install.bat即可。

* 备注：
## Vista loader 是通过Bootmgr加载，因此安装之前如有必要应先修复Vista的MBR。
## Vista loader 将启动信息写入第一扇区，因此通过Grub也可能启动：chainloader (hd0,0)+1
## 如运行install.bat之后不准备立即重新启动，可预先修改程序目录下另一个文件（SetupComplete.cmd）。
## v2.1.5的启动文件为vista，不读取menu.lst。之前版本的启动文件为grldr,并且读取menu.lst。在menu.lst中配置Vista启动项时，应加入acpi命令，以模拟OEM BIOS.
