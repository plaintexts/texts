====== Cursors ======
Created Saturday 12 April 2008


== Installation options ==

There are three basic ways to install the themes:

	1. System-wide:
**	/usr/share/cursors/xorg-x11**

	2. System-wide in the local directory
** 	/usr/local/share/cursors/xorg-x11**

	3. For one user only
**        ~/.icons/**	

User-specific settings override local settings, which override system-wide settings.

**Installing the theme**

To install a theme, download the theme and unpack it. You should have a directory structure like the following:

	* theme_name
	      o index.theme
	      o cursors
	            + cursor files…

Move the entire theme_name directory to the installation destination: **/usr/share/cursors/xorg-x11/,** **/usr/local/share/cursors/xorg-x11/**, or **~/.icons/**.

== Choosing a default theme ==

There’s a concept of a **default theme**. The default theme is located in the **default/ **subdirectory of wherever you’ve installed your theme. This is how the system decides which theme to use — it uses the “default” theme. It reads the index.theme file and looks at it.

If you installed your theme system-wide or system-wide local, you need to edit the /usr/share/cursors/xorg-x11/default/index.theme or the /usr/local/share/cursors/xorg-x11/default/index.theme file. Specify the default theme should inherit from the theme you want to use. For example, here is the default X11 theme if you haven’t specified anything else:

[Icon Theme]
Inherits=core

That file tells X11 to use the core cursor theme — the one built right into X11 itself. If you want to use the neutral theme instead, edit the file thusly:

[Icon Theme]
Inherits=neutral

If you installed the theme in your ~/.icons/ directory, you can do several different things:

* Rename the theme directory from theme_directory to **default**.
* Leave your themes in their original directories, and make a default directory and create in it a single file called **index.theme** with the contents as shown just above.
* Leave your themes in their original directories, and make a symlink named default to the theme directory. For instance,// ln -sfnT ~/.icons/redhat9cursors/ ~/.icons/default.// 

**Or,anotherway,the Xresources**

Place the following two lines to the Xresources file,either** /etc/X11/Xresources** or **~/.Xresource**

//Xcursor.theme: CursorThemeName//
//Xcursor.size: 32//
