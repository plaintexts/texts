** lsof -p <pid>
*** list files opened by the process ID: "<pid>"
** cd -
*** change directory to the previous directory
** locate -d <pattern>
*** find matching filenames using shell "<pattern>"
* 3.5.8 Network service initialization
** Some network services can be started on demand using the super-server inetd (or its equivalents). The inetd is started at boot time by "/etc/rc2.d/S20inetd" (for RUNLEVEL=2) which is a symlink to "/etc/init.d/inetd". Essentially, inetd allows one running daemon to invoke several others, reducing load on the system.
** Whenever a request for service arrives at super-server inetd , its protocol and service are identified by looking them up in the databases in "/etc/protocols" and "/etc/services". inetd then looks up a normal Internet service in the "/etc/inetd.conf" database, or a Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC)/Sun RPC based service in "/etc/rpc.conf".
** Sometimes, inetd does not start the intended server directly but starts the TCP wrapper program, tcpd(8), with the intended server name as its argument in "/etc/inetd.conf". In this case, tcpd runs the appropriate server program after logging the request and doing some additional checks using "/etc/hosts.deny" and "/etc/hosts.allow".
* 3.5.9 The system message
** The system message can be customized by "/etc/default/syslogd" and "/etc/syslog.conf" for both the log file and on-screen display. See syslogd(8) and syslog.conf(5). See also Section 9.2.2, “Log analyzer”.
* 3.5.10. The kernel message
** The kernel message can be customized by "/etc/default/klogd" for both the log file and on-screen display. Set "KLOGD='-c 3'" in this file and run "/etc/init.d/klogd restart". See klogd(8).
* 3.5.11. The udev system
** If "/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/modules.dep" was not generated properly by depmod(8) for some reason, modules may not be loaded as expected by the udev system. Execute "depmod -a" to fix it.
* 4.2. Managing account and password information
** etent passwd <user_name>
*** browse account information of "<user_name>"
** getent shadow <user_name> 	
*** browse shadowed account information of "<user_name>"
** getent group <group_name> 	
*** browse group information of "<group_name>"
** passwd -e 	
*** set one-time password for the account activation
** chage 	
*** manage password aging information
