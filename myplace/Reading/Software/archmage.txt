ARCHMAGE(1)                                                        ARCHMAGE(1)



NAME
       archmage - CHM(Compiled HTML) Decompressor.

SYNOPSIS
       archmage chmfile directory
       archmage -p port chmfile

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the archmage command.  This manual
       page was written for the Debian distribution because the original  pro‐
       gram does not have a manual page.

       arCHMage  is  an  extensible reader and decompiler for files in the CHM
       format. This is the format used by Microsoft HTML  Help,  and  is  also
       known as Compiled HTML. arCHMage is based on python-chm binding to chm‐
       lib from GnoCHM project.

USAGE
       There is three ways to use arCHMage package now:

       1) Extract .chm to directory (directory will be created):

            archmage <chmfile> <directory>

       2) Run as http-server, which will publish chm file contents  on  speci‐
       fied port:

            archmage -p <port> <chmfile>

       3)  Tune  your apache to publish chm file contents if there is trailing
       slash in request to that file (you will  need  working  mod_python  for
       that):

            Add that lines to your httpd.conf:

               AddHandler python-program .chm
               PythonHandler archmod.mod_chm

            Restart apache.

       Let’s suppose, you have file sample.chm in DocumentRoot of your apache.
       After that tuning you can receive raw  chm  file,  if  you  point  your
       browser to

            http://yourserver/sample.chm

       or you can view chm file on the fly if you point your browser to

            http://yourserver/sample.chm/ (note trailing slash)

FILES
       /etc/archmage/arch.conf
              System-wide configuration file.
